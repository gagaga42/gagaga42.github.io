## Shor's algorithm

  First proposed in 1994, Shor's algorithm was one of the very first quantum algorithms that tackled problem of actual interest. While Shor's algorithm can be used to compute discrete logarithms, it is most famous for factoring integers in polynomial time. 
  
  This post is brief introduction/summary of Shor's algorithm and its components.

### Factoring integers

  Before diving into the circuit implementation, how does Shor's algorithm attempt to factor an arbitrarily large integer $N$? 
  
  Assume $N$ is some large composite number(number we want to factor). Pick an integer $a$ such that $a$ is smaller than $N$, and is a coprime of $N$. Then, find the smallest positive integer $r$ that makes $a^r \equiv 1 \pmod N$. (This would mean $ a^r-1$ is some multiple of $N$, say $m*N$) Such $r$ is referred to as the period of the modulo function. 
  
  If $r$ happens to be even, $m*N$ can be broken down into 2 parts.
  <br>

  $$\begin{align} 
  m*N = (a^{r/2}-1)*(a^{r/2}+1)
  \end{align}$$ 
  
  And if $a^{r/2}+1$ or $a^{r/2}-1$ is not a multiple of $N$, they will each contain nontrivial factors of $N$. These factors can be found by finding the greatest common divisor - $gcd(a^{r/2}-1, N)$ , $gcd(a^{r/2}+1, N)$ - a job to which an efficient algorithm is already found. Shor's algorithm tells us that around half of the times, $r$ will be even. If not, we can just pick another $a$ and repeat. 

  Thus the key to factorization becomes finding the period $r$, a task Shor's algorithm achieves efficiently.

### Shor's algorithm to Quantum circuit (in steps)

  Now that we've got basic understanding of the logic behind Shor's algorithm, how is Shor's algorithm implemented in quantum circuit? Unlike classical computers, quantum computers can calculate all the different states in superposition simultaneously & independently. Although we are able to measure only one out of the many superpositions in the end, we can still somehow manipulate the qubits in order to obtain the intended answer with high probability. 
  <br>

  $$\begin{align} 
  7^0 \equiv 1 \pmod {15}, \   7^1 \equiv 7 \pmod {15}, \   7^2 \equiv 4 \pmod {15}, \   7^3 \equiv 13 \pmod {15} \\
  7^4 \equiv 1 \pmod {15}, \   7^5 \equiv 7 \pmod {15}, \   7^6 \equiv 4 \pmod {15}, \   7^7 \equiv 13 \pmod {15} \\
  \end{align}$$ 

  If we were to calculate the period of modulo function(such as the one above) in classical computers, we would have to calculate result of the modulo function seperately for each input. In quantum computers however, we can feed multiple inputs in to a function simultaneously by exploiting superposition. 

  Below steps are just one way of implementing Shor's algorithm in circuits.
  <br>

#### Step 1. Preparing the registers

Assuming $N$ is the number we want to factor, 2 registers will be used - one with $m = \lceil \log_2 N \rceil$ qubits and one with $2m + 1$ qubits. The one with $m$ qubits(output register) will be used to store results of modulo function, while the other one(input register) will be used for phase estimation. Prepare input register so that every qubits are in superposition of $\frac{1}{2^{1/2}}\  ( |0\rangle + |1\rangle$ ) $ using $ 2m + 1 $ Hadamard gates. Also, set the output register to $ |1\rangle $ .

  <br>

  1. output register : The results of modulo $N$ function will range from $0$ from $N-1$ at most. To store these results, $m = \lceil \log_2 N \rceil$ qubits are used. 

<br>

  2. input register : To achieve needed precision even in worst case. Assume $|x\rangle$ is the measurement result in input register during quantum phase estimation, while $Q$ is number of qubits in input register. It turns out $\frac{x}{2^Q}\ $ approximates to $\frac{s}{r}\ $, where $s$ is some integer. The worst case is when $s = 1$ with period $r$ approaching $N$, making it very hard to distinguish $\frac{1}{r}\ $ from $\frac{1}{r+1}\ $. So to achieve necessary precision, we want $|\frac{x}{2^Q}\ - \frac{s}{r}\ | < \frac{1}{2N^2}\ $. This can be achieved by setting $Q = 2m + 1$.

  <summary> Explanation on why the registers are prepared in such way </summary>

  <br>
  1. input reg : To exploit superposition. We are trying to feed all the inputs $|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$, ... , $|2^{2m + 1}-1\rangle $ at once. 
  
  <br><br>
  $\begin{align} 
    |0\rangle + |1\rangle + ... + |2^{2m + 1}-1\rangle = |++++...++\rangle
  \end{align}$
  <br>

  2. output reg : To be used in quantum phase estimation. Say we were to apply a controlled-unitary gate $U$. If the target qubit is an eigenvector of $U$, the control qubit actually gets its phase shifted while the target qubit remains unchanged. This phenomenon is called 'phase kickback'. But how do we know the eigenvector of $U$, when we don't even know its phase? Fortunately, we don't need to know what all the individual eigenvectors are. It turns out, When you sum up the $r$ eigenvectors, it just becomes $|1\rangle$. 
  
</details>

#### Step 2. Applying $U$ repeatedly (modulo function)

By $U$, we mean the unitary gate that performs following modulo function. 

$$\begin{align} 
    U|x\rangle = |ax \bmod N\rangle
  \end{align}$$

To perform quantum phase estimation on $U$, we apply controlled-U repeatedly on the qubits of input register. $U^{2^n}$ simply means $U$ is being applied $2^n$ times. $U^{2^0}$ for first qubit, $U^{2^1}$ for second qubit, ... and so on. 
<br>

<details>
  <summary> Computing circuits for modular exponentiation </summary>

  But how do we build the circuit for $U^{2^n}$ as $n$ gets larger? Although there is a relatively efficient method for computing such circuits - known as "repeated squaring" -, this step is still considered a bottleneck in Shor's algorithm and main source of complexity. 

</details>

#### Step 3. Applying Inverse quantum fourier transform

We then apply inverse quantum fourier transform on the input register to complete quantum phase estimation. After IQFT, input register will store superposition of all the phases, each phase corresponding to one eigenvectors. 


#### Step 4. Measurement and finding the period

Finally, we perform measurement on the input register. The measurement result $x$ will hold information on the phase and period of $U$. Divide $x$ by $Q$, and $\frac{x}{2^Q}\ $ will approximate to $\frac{s}{r}\ $, where $s$ is some integer. We can then use continued fraction expansion to make multiple guesses of $r$. Fortunately, one of these guesses will end up being the actual period we need in many cases(roughly half). 

Once period $r$ has been found, we can just compute $gcd(a^{r/2}-1, N)$ , $gcd(a^{r/2}+1, N)$ classically to complete factoring $N$ :)

##### etc

Personally, even after understanding the overall logic behind Shor's algorithm, understanding the actual circuit implementation & details was quite challenging. I'm still not sure if I got all the details (ex: reason behind input register size, algorithm for computing $U$ efficiently) correctly, and I'll just have to take some time to delve deeper. 

Also, thorough understanding of quantum fourier transformation, quantum phase estimation, phase kickback would be helpful for understanding Shor's algorithm.
