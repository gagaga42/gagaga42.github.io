## Shor's algorithm

  First proposed in 1994, Shor's algorithm was one of the very first quantum algorithms that tackled problem of actual interest. While Shor's algorithm can be used to compute discrete logarithms, it is most famous for factoring integers in polynomial time. 
  
  This post is brief introduction/summary of Shor's algorithm and its components.
